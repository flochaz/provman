/**
 * Test Home Delivery CDK app via snapshot testing.
 *
 * The test synthesizes a JSON CloudFormation template and verifies if it has been changed from the previous version.
 * (which was saved as DeliveryAppTest.snap)
 * If there is any change, the run will fail with "io.github.jsonSnapshot.SnapshotMatchException"
 *
 * This mechanism forces us to verify that there is no unintended change on the infrastructure when refactoring the code.
 * In the code review, we can see the changes in the diff and manually verify that.
 *
 * To update the snapshot, you have to manually delete `DeliveryAppTest.snap` and rerun the test.
 *
 * For convenience, removal of the snapshot is done automatically within the `removeSnapshot()` task in build.gradle.
 * We recommend that developers use `cdk diff` to inspect changes to their infrastructure before attempting to deploy.
 * However, for extra precaution the `removeSnapshot()` task can be omitted and developers can be forced to manually
 * remove the snapshot so they don't forget to inspect any changes.
 *
 * See https://json-snapshot.github.io/ for more details on the Snapshot library
